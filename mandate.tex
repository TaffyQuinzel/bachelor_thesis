\section{Working title}
Emerging practical patterns within programs written in a modern, stat-of-the-ort language
\section{Motive}
Making compilers for programming languages is a difficult task, as every language is different and needs different features.
From this problem Meta-Compiler (from now on abreviate as MC) came into existence.
As the name suggests it is a programming language made to build compilers in.
The language aims to make the process of making compilers easier.

However MC has not yet been tested in the field yet, which brings us to the goal of the assignment.

\section{Importance}
The result of this paper will give some insight of the practicality of MC and how far it is from its endgoal.
This will be used in the further development and improvment of MC.

\section{Goal}
The main goal is to test MC with a practical application.
This is done by creating a test application which has the following steps of progressing difficulty:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item For a minnimum passing grade of 6:
      A small interactive and graphical application.
   \item For an 8:
      Within the application for a 6, add traversable and changable datastructures.
   \item And for a 1
      Within the application for an 8, add coroutines.
\end{enumerate}

After which the result is reflected upon.

\section{Problem}
Currently there are several working versions of MC available, but none of these implement the entire language.
The newest development version is the one that will be used for this assignment.
This version has no working compiler yet and is therefor easily adapted to bugs found during testing.

\section{Central research question and subquestions}
How practical is the programming language MC in comparison to other languages?
\begin{enumerate}
   \item What is MC?
   \item How does MC work?
   \item How does MC differ with other languages?
   \item Which purpose does MC have?
   \item How practical is MC in its use?
\end{enumerate}
